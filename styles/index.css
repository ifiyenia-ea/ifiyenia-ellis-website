/* I have struggled so much with these "containers"
    not being able to make it look good on both
    my laptop screen and my second, bigger one.
    I've read a lot about flexbox, parents and children
    but once again thought it was best to wait and
    just decide to settle with this that kind of works.
    I have the same problem with the width of the text but
    at least adding the right padding under "p" in percentage
    instead of pixels which makes a better adjustment,
    but still not perfect on the bigger screen.
    Have a feeling the solution for these two problems
    might be the same? */
